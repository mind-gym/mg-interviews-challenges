# Google Places API Kata

This coding kata is intended to give you a small exercise that you can complete in your own time before attending a face to face interview with ONZO.

The idea is to provide you with a realistic scenario that lets you show off how skilled you are! We are expecting your code to be **production quality**

**Please spend around 2-4 hours on this kata. This should give you enough time to come with a good, working solution.**

## Requirements

You will need to build a web application that integrates with the [Google Places API](https://developers.google.com/places/)
and allows you to search for a type of business (e.g. pubs) and give information on venues nearby that are currently open.

You can display the results as you see fit in a nicely designed web app.

## Rules

*   You will need to sign up as a Google developer and create an app in order to use their services.
*   You can use any language, platform, framework or libraries you think will get the job done (Vue.js is good though!).
*   Give us nice clean readable code.
*   Development best practices are followed.
*   We must be able to build and run your code without any errors (be it at compilation time or runtime).
*   Please fork this repository and submit a solution via pull request.
*   **Check in your code frequently.**
*   When you submit your code please put a summary in the README.md explaining approach.

## Bonus Credit

*   Use Vue.js
*   Using a build tool to build the code and fetch dependencies.
*   Use a test runner to run the tests.
*   Create a deployable artifact or deploy within a container.
