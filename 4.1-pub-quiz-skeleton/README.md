# Pub Quiz Kata

## Background

All we seem to do nowadays is pub quizzes. On Zoom... With the family... With
friends. Pub quizzes everywhere. We see an opportunity for an online pub quiz
system for the mass market.

## The Brief

We would like you to create a prototype system for an online pub quiz in NodeJS & Vue, or any other technologies you prefer.

> When a participant joins in with the pub quiz
>
> Then their answers are marked fairly
>
> So that there is no cheating

## The Questions

1. The first ever commercial bungee jump took place in which country? (a) South Africa, (b) Australia, or (c) **New Zealand**
2. When did the British children's television programme Blue Peter first air? (a)**1958**, (b)1968, or (c)1978
3. Where did Disney open a resort on June 16, 2016? (a) Singapore, (b) **Shanghai**, or (c) Tokyo

We have included a JSON representation of this in [quiz.json](./quiz.json), and a TypeScript representation of this in [app/src/server/quiz.ts](./app/src/server/quiz.ts). Feel free to use this or not. Also manipulate it as you desire.

## Approach

Through this exercise we're looking for:

* An application with no data persistence. 90 minutes is not a long time!
* Excellent code in your most comfortable area of the stack.
* Proficiency in the areas where you are less comfortable.
* Clean and idiomatic code with an adherence to the correct paradigms.
* The same development practices you use in your day job.
* Great communication. You will be interacting with individuals of diverse skill levels.

Feel free to use the Internet (Google, Travis or libraries / frameworks etc...) Whatever makes your life easier. You can use the code in the `app` directory to get started.
