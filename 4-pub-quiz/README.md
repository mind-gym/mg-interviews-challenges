## The Brief

We would like you to create a prototype system for an online pub quiz in NodeJS & React.

> When a participant joins in with the pub quiz 
>
> Then their answers are marked fairly
>
> So that there is no cheating

## The Questions

1. The first ever commercial bungie jump took place in which country? (a) South Africa, (b) Australia, or (c) **New Zealand**
2. When did the British children's television programme Blue Peter first air? (a)**1958**, (b)1968, or (c)1978

We have included a json representation of this in [quiz.json](./quiz.json). Feel free to use this or not. Also manipulate
it as you desire.

## Approach

Through this exercise we're looking for:

* An application with no data persistence. 90 minutes is not a long time!
* Excellent code in your most comfortable area of the stack.
* Proficiency in the areas where you are less comfortable.
* Clean and idiomatic code with an adherence to the correct paradigms.
* The same development practices you use in your day job.
* Great communication. You will be interacting with individuals of diverse skill levels.

Feel free to use the Internet (Google, Travis or libraries / frameworks etc...) Whatever makes your life easier.
